# tezos-ipfs (WIP)

`tipfs` helps coordinate storage replication, and quick distribution of objects on IPFS,
it can run with either an external, full IPFS node, or with a minimal embedded IPFS node depending on the use case.
# Ipfs Basics
All communication and coordination between tipfs instances happens via the IPFS network, It is a good idea to take a few minutes
to understand the [basics of IPFS](./docs/ipfs_basics.md).

# Configuration
For documentation examples, please see [Common use cases](./docs/common_use.md)
