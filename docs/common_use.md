# Common use cases

In tezos, generally, we have the following use cases, we provide documentation for every one of them:

* [I want to run a storage server, for others to use](./use_cases/public_Storage.md)
* [I want to store and access data from others](./use_cases/storage_and_gateway.md)
* [I want to only access data from others](./use_cases/simple_gateway.md)
* [My Users need to upload data to someone's storage server](./use_cases/upload_external.md)
* [My Users need to upload data to our own storage server]((./use_cases/storage_and_gateway.md))
