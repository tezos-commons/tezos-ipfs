# Common use cases

In tezos, generally, we have the following use cases, we provide documentation for every one of them:

* [I want to run a storage server, for others to use](./use_cases/public_Storage.md)
* I want to store and access data from others
* [I want to only access data from others](./use_cases/simple_gateway.md)
* My Users need to upload data to someone's storage server
* My Users need to upload data to our own storage server

There is reference config, showing all options here: [Full Config Example](./use_cases/full_config.md)
